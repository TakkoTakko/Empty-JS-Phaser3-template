The goal is to collect as many coins as possible in the given time of 30 seconds (by default).

There are 3 difficulties: Easy, Medium and Hard. <br>
The difficulty can be changed by clicking on the current difficulty (right upper corner).

- Easy: the spawn rate of the coins is 1 coin per 0.75 seconds

The speed off the basket slows down as the level of difficulty increases.
